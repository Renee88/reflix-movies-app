This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Reflix

A Front-end app, designed for movie rental, that uses local storage to serve data relevant to each account. The app enables rental of a desired movie per account, and gives a short description about each movie.  

### Tech Stack

- ReactJS
- React router-dom

## Prerequisites

- Clone the directory.
- While in that directory, run ```npm install``` 

### To run the app

- Run ```npm start``` in the root directory.

## Available features

- A flexible search mechanism to enable quick tracking of the content of interest.
- A simple add user button
- User based movie rental.

## Future features

- Serve a broader and non-hardcoded list of movies, using a suitable api.
